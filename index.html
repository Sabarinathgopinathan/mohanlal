                            Mohanlal Viswanathan (born 21 May 1960), known
                            mononymously as Mohanlal, is an Indian actor, film
                            producer, playback singer, film distributor, and
                            director who predominantly works in Malayalam cinema
                            besides also having sporadically appeared in Tamil,
                            Hindi, Telugu and Kannada-language films.<sup

                            Mohanlal has a prolific career spanning over four
                            decades, during which he has acted in more than 400
                            films.<sup>[4][6]</sup> Mohanlal's contributions to
                            the Malayalam cinema have been praised by his
                            contemporaries in the Indian film industry.<sup

                            >
                            The Government of India honoured him with Padma Shri
                            in 2001,[10] and Padma Bhushan in 2019, India's
                            fourth and third highest civilian honours,[11] for
                            his contributions to Indian cinema. In 2009, he
                            became the first actor in India to be awarded the
                            honorary rank of Lieutenant colonel in the
                            Territorial Army.[12][13] Mohanlal was named as one
                            of "the men who changed the face of the Indian
                            Cinema" by CNN-News18.[14] Mohanlal made his acting
                            debut at age 18 in the Malayalam film Thiranottam in
                            1978, but the film was delayed in its release for 25
                            years due to censorship issues. His screen debut was
                            in the 1980 romance film Manjil Virinja Pookkal, in
                            which he played the antagonist.[15][16] He continued
                            to do villainous roles and rose to secondary lead
                            roles in the following years. By the mid-1980s, he
                            established himself as a bankable leading actor and
                            attained stardom after starring in several
                            successful films in 1986; the crime drama Rajavinte
                            Makan released that year heightened his stardom.[15]
                            Mohanlal prefers to work in Malayalam films, but he
                            has also appeared in some of Hindi, Tamil, Telugu
                            and Kannada films. Some of his best known
                            non-Malayalam films include the Tamil political
                            drama Iruvar (1997), the Hindi crime drama Company
                            (2002) and the Telugu film Janatha Garage
                            (2016).[17][18] Mohanlal has won five National Film
                            Awardsâ€”two Best Actor, a Special Jury Mention and a
                            Special Jury Award for acting, and an award for Best
                            Feature Film (as producer), also nine Kerala State
                            Film Awards and Filmfare Awards South and numerous
                            other accolades. He received honorary doctorates
                            from Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit in
                            2010[19] and the University of Calicut in 2018.[20]
                            Mohanlal is also known for his philanthropic
                            endeavours. He founded the ViswaSanthi Foundation, a
                            non-profit charitable organization that was started
                            to create and deliver high-impact and focused
                            programs to the underprivileged sections of society
                            in the areas of Healthcare and
                            Education.[21][22][23]
